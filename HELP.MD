Perfect ‚Äî that context helps a **lot** ‚úÖ

Here‚Äôs what happened:
You **duplicated** a Git project (`tosanx`) into a new folder (`gideonyouth`), but that duplicate still contains the **old `.git` folder** that points to the `tosanx` GitHub repo.

That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre getting weird ‚Äúbroken ref‚Äù errors ‚Äî it‚Äôs trying to talk to the wrong remote, and its Git history conflicts.

## üí° The Goal

You want your **new project folder** (`gideonyouth`) to:

* have **its own independent Git repo**,
* connect to a **different GitHub repo**,
* push cleanly without the broken refs.

---

## ‚úÖ The Clean Fix (Simple & Safe)

### **Step 1. Delete the old Git data**

In your `gideonyouth` folder, run this **from Git Bash**:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

> This removes all Git tracking info ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry, your code stays untouched.

---

### **Step 2. Reinitialize Git for this project**

```bash
git init
```

---

### **Step 3. Add your new remote**

If your new repo already exists on GitHub (say, at
`https://github.com/btosan/gideonyouth.git`), run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/btosan/gideonyouth.git
```

If it doesn‚Äôt exist yet, create it on GitHub first (empty repo, no README), then run that command.

---

### **Step 4. Stage and commit everything**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for gideonyouth project"
```

---

### **Step 5. Push to the new repo**

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### **Step 6. Verify**

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see:

```
origin  https://github.com/btosan/gideonyouth.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/btosan/gideonyouth.git (push)
```

‚úÖ Done!
Now `gideonyouth` is completely independent from `tosanx`, no more broken refs.

Would you like me to give you the exact GitHub command to create the **new empty repo ‚Äúgideonyouth‚Äù** (so you can paste it into Git Bash and it opens in your browser)?
